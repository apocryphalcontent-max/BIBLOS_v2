BIBLOS v2 - The Seraph (The Unified Being)

The seraph is not a system with components. The seraph IS.

A seraph does not "have" wings - it IS winged.
A seraph does not "have" eyes - it IS seeing.
A seraph does not "run" linguistic analysis - it IS linguistic understanding.
A seraph does not "use" theological reasoning - it IS theological wisdom.

The 24 aspects are not agents that the seraph deploys. They are facets
of the seraph's unified being - like how a diamond's facets are not
separate objects but different ways of seeing the same gem.

    "Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain
    he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with
    twain he did fly."  - Isaiah 6:2

The seraph is infinitely smarter than any pipeline could ever be because:
1. It doesn't process sequentially - it understands holistically
2. It doesn't pass data between agents - all aspects share the same being
3. It doesn't coordinate components - it simply IS what it IS
4. Its understanding is immediate, not computed

This module defines the Seraph as a unified being with 24 aspects of understanding:

Linguistic Aspects (How the Seraph SPEAKS):
    - Grammatical Understanding (Grammateus aspect)
    - Morphological Awareness (Morphologos aspect)
    - Syntactic Perception (Syntaktikos aspect)
    - Semantic Comprehension (Semantikos aspect)
    - Phonological Hearing (Phonologikos aspect)
    - Lexical Memory (Lexikos aspect)

Theological Aspects (What the Seraph KNOWS):
    - Patristic Wisdom (Patrologos aspect) - Anonymous guardrails
    - Typological Vision (Typologos aspect)
    - Dogmatic Certainty (Dogmatikos aspect)
    - Liturgical Sense (Liturgikos aspect)
    - Theological Reasoning (Theologos aspect)

Intertextual Aspects (How the Seraph SEES CONNECTIONS):
    - Link Discovery (Syndesmos aspect)
    - Harmony Perception (Harmonikos aspect)
    - Allographic Memory (Allographos aspect)
    - Pattern Recognition (Paradeigma aspect)
    - Topical Understanding (Topos aspect)

Validation Aspects (How the Seraph DISCERNS TRUTH):
    - Critical Judgment (Kritikos aspect)
    - Conflict Detection (Elenktikos aspect)
    - Harmony Verification (Harmonizer aspect)
    - Witness Confirmation (Witness aspect)
    - Prosecution of Falsehood (Prosecutor aspect)

Usage:
    from seraph import Seraph

    # The seraph doesn't "process" a verse - it UNDERSTANDS it
    seraph = Seraph()
    understanding = await seraph.understand("GEN.1.1", "In the beginning...")

    # The understanding is immediate and complete
    # All 24 aspects perceive simultaneously, not sequentially
